# Compare the cycling networks of two European cities: Berlin ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª and Paris ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
- This data exploration self-assignment was born out of a personal interest for the topic. I've lived in both cities and developed very subjective feelings regarding the quality of their respective cycling networks. I wanted to explore this topic through data, in order to gain a different perspective on it.
