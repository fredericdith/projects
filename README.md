# Project 1: Compare the cycling networks of two European cities: Berlin 🇩🇪 and Paris 🇫🇷
![project 1](https://github.com/fredericdith/projects/assets/1576325/ce183138-665f-4a2a-98d9-d8848fdee230)

- This data exploration self-assignment was born out of a personal interest for the topic. I've lived in both cities and developed very subjective feelings regarding the quality of their respective cycling networks. I wanted to explore this topic through data, in order to gain a different perspective on it.
